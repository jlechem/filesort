Welcome to the readme text file for filesort.  This file gives a brief introduction to the filesort development environment setup.  Filesort was created in Visual Studio 2008 and is set to use that development environment.  Earlier version of visual studio will not correctly open the project solution file.  As Visual Studio versions progress expect the project solution to progress with them.

I have tried to write nothing but ANSI C++ for this project.  So while the solution is windows centric the source code should be able to be compiled for multiple other OSes with little effort.  I haven't actually compiled the code using gcc, minGW, etc but it should be able to work.

Best regards,
