Welcome to the readme text file for filesort.  This file gives a brief introduction to the filesort development environment setup.  Filesort was originally created in Visual Studio 2008 and is now currently set to be used in Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2017.

I have tried to write nothing but ANSI C++ for this project.  So while the solution is windows centric the source code should be able to be compiled for multiple other OSes with little effort.  I haven't actually compiled the code using gcc, minGW, etc but it should be able to work.

Best regards,
